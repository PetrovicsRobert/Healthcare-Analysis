## Insights

#### High Billing Amount for X-Rays: 
X-Rays posesses the highest total billing amount among procedures, showing that they are a common diagnostic tool and may suggest high usage or high costs associated with this procedure.
#### Significant Costs in Orthopedics: 
The Orthopedics department has the highest total billing amount among departments, which could indicate high procedure costs or a large number of patients needing orthopedic care.
#### Hypertension Management: 
Hypertension shows up often across different service types with significant billing amounts, highlighting the need for effective management and prevention efforts.
#### Emergency vs. Inpatient Costs: 
Emergency services usually make up a larger part of the total bills compared to inpatient services. This points to a possible opportunity to save money by improving how we manage outpatient care and focus more on preventive measures.

## Recommendations

#### Cost Management in High-Expense Departments: 
Focus on cost-reduction strategies in high-expense departments like Orthopedics and Cardiology without compromising patient care.
#### Preventive Care Programs: 
Implement preventive care programs, especially for chronic conditions like hypertension, to reduce emergency visits and inpatient admissions.
#### Optimize Diagnostic Procedures: 
Review the use and costs of diagnostic procedures such as X-Rays and CT Scans to ensure they are used appropriately and cost-effectively.
#### Patient Education: 
Focus on patient education on managing chronic conditions to reduce the need for emergency care.
